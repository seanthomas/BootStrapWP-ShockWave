	* 	Misc Plugins: 

		*	Donation Can - http://treehouseapps.com/donation-can/ - Found from -http://wpmu.org/3-must-have-plugins-for-musicians-and-bands/

		-	Crowd funding using Donation Can:

				Crowd funding (http://www.socan.ca/words-music/crowdfunding-pre-financing-your-next-recording) has become a staple of being an indie artist or band. I’ve had a lot of success with it selling tickets to my shows recently. Donation Can allows me to create a “Cause” or “Fundraiser” (most fund raisers are hosted as an event). I set a goal which is displayed as a progress bar in a post http://afterrunnymede.com/news/band-on-the-run-city-finals/). People then see how I am progressing towards that goal and how they are helping me reach it.

				What’s nice about this plugin is that it also lets me create my own custom thank you page (where I might offer a free mp3 download). It also lets me set the donation rates or the option for visitors to define their own donation amount. This is how I sold tickets to the last few shows I played. I’d set a minimum donation of $12 which was the cost of the ticket and include a free album download on the thank you page (just a secrete download link).

				But how does it collect money? Paypal baby! I’ve been on that band-wagon for years now and I’ve had no complaints. I have a Standard Business account with PayPal which allows me to process credit cards on my website. I also find that transferring my funds to my bank account never takes more than 2 days… I just need to be sure to make the request before 6 am Monday morning ;) Trust me it’s the cheapest way to process credit cards which helps those who don’t have the cash or helps you from hustling on the street. I for one would rather market online than the streets.
